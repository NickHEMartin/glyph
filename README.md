### Dot-glyph

Final Update.
After going through some different design styles for my glyphs I have decided to settle on this one as my final as it is the best I could make. I tried to use animation to my advantage but came to a conclusion that it was out of my knowledge and stuck with a similar design to the animation adding an outer rim. I like how I have used the dots in my work with them working with density and size which was my original intent with the dots and I am happy with the outcome shown.

I have shown hue through rotation of all of the dots, saturation through density and movement of the smaller few dots and changing the gradient of the outer rim and the dots, and finally lightness which was shown through the different sizes of all the balls and the different gradients used.

Github doesnt open the files properly so the best way to view them is downloading the files and opening up the index.html file to view to view the clock.
